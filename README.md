Race cost calculator for the Spartan Running Club @ CWRU.

## What do it do?
The Race Cost Calculator (RCC) is tailored to calculate race expenses for the Spartan Running Club @ CWRU. It is mostly made for calculating Run Signup race registration as it can (relatively) accurately take into account [Run Signups's specific processing fee calculations](https://info.runsignup.com/pricing/) and [Campus Groups's Stripe processing fee of 2.9% + $0.3 per transaction](https://case.edu/studentlife/services/campusgroups/online-payments).

The main use of the calculator is estimating the cost group members have to pay in order for SRC to register everybody for the race! This previously tedious, stress-inducing, and confusing calculation has now been greatly simplified and streamlined through advances in complex mathematics ~~elementary school algebra~~ and computer science ~~basic python~~ to take the guesswork and headache out of the SRC treasurer's job.
